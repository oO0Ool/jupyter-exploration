# jupyter-exploration

This is an example repository for the "Intro to Jupyter and GitHub" assignment that aims to help us familiarize ourselves with these platforms. There is also a second part beyond this GitHub portion where I will be using Google Colab to create and explore Jupyter Notebook basics such as what cells are, how to run cells, markdown formatting, and running simple python code. The notebook I create will be uploaded to this repository when finished using GitHub Desktop.
